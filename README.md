## Introduction

*wopr* is an R package that provides API access to the
<a href="https://wopr.worldpop.org" target="_blank">WorldPop Open
Population Repository</a>. This gives users the ability to:

1.  Download WorldPop population data sets directly from the R console,
2.  Submit spatial queries (points or polygons) to the WorldPop server
    to retrieve population estimates within user-defined geographic
    areas,
3.  Get estimates of population sizes for specific demographic groups
    (i.e. age and sex), and
4.  Get probabilistic estimates of uncertainty for all population
    estimates.
5.  Run the
    <a href='https://apps.worldpop.org/woprVision' target='_blank'>woprVision</a>
    web application locally from the R console.

Code for the *wopr* package is openly available on GitHub:
<a href='https://github.com/wpgp/wopr' target='_blank'>https://github.com/wpgp/wopr</a>.

## Installation

First, start a new R session. Then, install the *wopr* R package from
WorldPop on GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github('wpgp/wopr')
library(wopr)
```

You may be prompted to update some of your existing R packages. This is
not required unless the *wopr* installation fails. You can avoid
checking for package updates by adding the argument `upgrade='never'`.
If needed, you can update individual packages that may be responsible
for any *wopr* installation errors using
`install.packages('package_name')`. Or, you can use
`devtools::install_github('wpgp/wopr', upgrade='ask')` to update all of
the packages that *wopr* depends on. In R Studio, you can also update
all of your R packages by clicking “Tools \> Check for Package Updates”.

Note: When updating multiple packages, it may be necessary to restart
your R session before each installation to ensure that packages being
updated are not currently loaded in your R environment.

## Usage

Demo code is provided in `demo/wopr_demo.R` that follows the examples in
this README.

You can list vignettes that are available using:
`vignette(package='wopr')`

The
<a href='https://apps.worldpop.org/woprVision' target='_blank'>woprVision
web application</a> is an interactive web map that allows you to query
population estimates from the
<a href='https://wopr.worldpop.org' target='_blank'>WorldPop Open
Population Repository</a>. See the vignette for woprVision with:
`vignette('woprVision', package='wopr')`

If you are intersted in developing your own front end applications that
query the WOPR API, please read the vignette that describes the API
backend for developers: `vignette('woprAPI', package='wopr')`

### woprVision

woprVision is an R shiny application that allows you to browse an
interactive map to get population estimates for specific locations and
demographic groups. woprVision is available on the web at
<a href='https://apps.worldpop.org/woprVision' target='_blank'>https://apps.worldpop.org/woprVision</a>.
You can also run woprVision locally from your R console using:

``` r
wopr::woprVision()
```

We suggest installing Michael Harper’s fix to the leaflet.extras draw
toolbar:

``` r
devtools::install_github("dr-harper/leaflet.extras")
```

This is not required, but it fixes a bug that prevents the draw toolbar
from being removed from the map when it is inactive.

### Data Download

One way to access data from WOPR is to simply download the files
directly to your computer from the R console. This can be done with
three easy steps:

``` r
# Retrieve the WOPR data catalogue
catalogue <- getCatalogue()

# Select files from the catalogue by subsetting the data frame
selection <- subset(catalogue,
                    country == 'NGA' &
                      category == 'Population' & 
                      version == 'v1.2')

# Download selected files
downloadData(selection)
```

Note: `'NGA'` refers to Nigeria. WOPR uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3" target="_blank">ISO
country codes</a> to abbreviate country names.

By default, `downloadData()` will not download files larger than 100 MB
unless you change the `maxsize` argument (see `?downloadData`). Using
the default settings, a folder named `./wopr` will be created in your R
working directory for downloaded files. A spreadsheet listing all WOPR
files currently saved to your hard drive can be found in
`./wopr/wopr_catalogue.csv`. To list the files that have been downloaded
to your working directory from within the R console, use
`list.files('wopr', recursive=T)`. In multiple calls to downloadData(),
files that you have previously downloaded will be overwritten if your
local files do not match the server files (based on an md5sums check).
This allows you to keep up-to-date local copies of every file.

You can download the entire WOPR data catalogue using:
`downloadData(getCatalogue(), maxsize=Inf)`. Note: Some files in the
WOPR data catalogue are very large (e.g. 140 GB), so please ensure that
you have enough disk space. If disk space is limited, you can restrict
the maximum file size that you woud like to download using the `maxsize`
argument (default = 100 MB).

### Spatial Query

Population estimates can also be obtained from WOPR using spatial
queries (geographic points or polygons) for user-defined geographic
area(s) and demographic group(s).

Spatial queries must be submitted using objects of class `sf`. You can
explore this functionality using example data from Nigeria that are
included with the `wopr` package. Plot the example data using:

``` r
data(wopr_points)
plot(wopr_points, pch=16)

data(wopr_polys)
plot(wopr_polys)
```

Note: ESRI shapefiles (and other file types) can be read into R as `sf`
objects using:

``` r
sf_feature <- sf::st_read('shapefile.shp')
```

To submit a spatial query, you must first identify which WOPR databases
support spatial queries:

``` r
getCatalogue(spatial_query=T)
```

This will return a `data.frame`:

<div style="width:200px">

| country | version |
|---------|---------|
| NGA     | v1.2    |
| NGA     | v1.1    |
| COD     | v1.0    |

</div>

These results indicate that there are currently two WOPR databases for
Nigeria (NGA) that support spatial queries and one database for
Democratic Republic of Congo (COD).

#### Query total population at a single point

To get the total population for a single point location from the NGA
v1.2 population estimates use:

``` r
N <- getPop(feature=wopr_points[1,], 
            country='NGA', 
            version='v1.2')
```

Notice that the population estimate is returned as a vector of samples
from the Bayesian posterior distribution:

``` r
print(N)
hist(N)
```

This can be summarized using:

``` r
summaryPop(N, confidence=0.95, tails=2, abovethresh=1e5, belowthresh=5e4)
```

The `confidence` argument controls the width of the confidence
intervals. The `tails` argument controls whether the confidence
intervals are calculated as one-tailed or two-tailed probabilities. If
`confidence=0.95` and `tails=2`, then there is a 95% probability that
the true population falls within the confidence intervals, given the
model structure and the data used to fit the model. If `confidence=0.95`
and `tails=1`, then there is a 95% chance that the true population
exceeds the lower confidence interval and a 95% chance that the true
population is less than the upper confidence interval.

The `abovethresh` argument defines the threshold used to calculate the
probability that the population will exceed this threshold. For example,
if `abovethresh=1e5`, then the `abovethresh` result from `summaryPop()`
is the probability that the population exceeds 100,000 people. The
`belowthresh` argument is similar except it will return the probability
that the population is less than this threshold.

#### Query total population within a single polygon

To query WOPR using a single polygon works exactly the same as a
point-based query:

``` r
N <- getPop(feature=wopr_polygons[1,], 
            country='NGA', 
            version='v1.2')

summaryPop(N, confidence=0.95, tails=2, abovethresh=1e2, belowthresh=50)
```

#### Query population for specific demographic groups

To query population estimates for specific demographic groups, you can
use the `agesex_select` argument (see `?getPop`). This argument accepts
a character vector of age-sex groups. `'f0'` represents females less
than one year old; `'f1'` represents females from age one to four;
`'f5'` represents females from five to nine; `'f10'` represents females
from 10 to 14; and so on. `'m0'` represents males less than one, etc.

Query the population of children under the age of five within a single
polygon:

``` r
N <- getPop(feature=wopr_polygons[1,], 
            country='NGA', 
            version='v1.2',
            agesex_select=c('f0','f1','m0','m1'))

summaryPop(N, confidence=0.95, tails=2, abovethresh=10, belowthresh=1)
```

If the `agesex` argument is not included, the `getPop()` function will
return estimates of the *total* population (as above).

#### Query multiple point or polygon features

We can query multiple point or polygon features using the `woprize()`
function:

``` r
N_table <- woprize(features=wopr_polys, 
                   country='NGA', 
                   version='1.2',
                   agesex_select=c('m0','m1','f0','f1'),
                   confidence=0.95,
                   tails=2,
                   abovethresh=2e4,
                   belowthresh=1e4
                   )
```

You can save these results in a number of ways:

``` r
# save results as shapefile
sf::st_write(N_table, 'example_shapefile.shp')

# save results as csv
write.csv(sf::st_drop_geometry(N_table), file='example_spreadsheet.csv', row.names=F)

# save image of mapped results
jpeg('example_map.jpg')
tmap::tm_shape(N_table) + tmap::tm_fill('mean', palette='Reds', legend.reverse=T)
dev.off()
```
